An archive file is a collection of files and directories that are stored in one file. The archive file is not compressed â€” it uses the same amount of disk space as all the individual files and directories combined. A compressed file is a collection of files and directories that are stored in one file and stored in a way that uses less disk space than all the individual files and directories combined. If you do not have enough disk space on your computer, you can compress files that you do not use very often or files that you want to save but do not use anymore. You can even create an archive file and then compress it to save disk space.

Compression tools: gzip, bzip2, or zip.
The bzip2 compression tool is recommended because it provides the most compression and is found on most UNIX-like operating systems. The gzip compression tool can also be found on most UNIX-like operating systems. If you need to transfer files between Linux and other operating system such as MS Windows, you should use zip because it is more commonly used on these other operating systems.
