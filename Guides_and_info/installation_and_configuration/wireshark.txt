1) Install wireshark.
If you run Wireshark as a non-root user (which you should) at this stage you will encounter an error message which says.
“No interface can be used for capturing in this system with the current configuration”.

The following steps will rectify this.

2) Create the Wireshark group.
$ sudo groupadd wireshark
Add your username to the Wireshark group -
$ sudo usermod -a -G wireshark USERNAME
Change the group  ownership of file dumpcap to wireshark -
$ sudo chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap
Change the mode of the file dumpcap to allow execution by the group wireshark -
$ sudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/dumpcap
Grant capabilities with setcap -
$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/dumpcap
Verify the change -
$ sudo getcap /usr/bin/dumpcap
